    "What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that learn patterns from the environment (training data) and make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. It enables tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering across various types of data — including text, images, and numerical values."
