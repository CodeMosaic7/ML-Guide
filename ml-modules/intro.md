# INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING

In simple terms, machine learning involves training a machine to learn patterns from the environment (training data) and evaluating its performance on unseen data (testing data). ML is used in:

1. Regresssion: Predicting continuous values (e.g., predicting house prices).
2. Classification: Categorizing data into discrete classes (e.g., spam or not spam).
3. Clustering: Grouping similar data points together without predefined labels (e.g., customer segmentation).

Advanced ML is widely used in autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, natural language processing, fraud detection and search engines like of netflix.

## Types of Learning 

1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each input is paired with the correct output. The algorithm learns the relationship between the inputs and outputs and uses this function to predict the output for new, unseen data. It's like a student learning with answer keys.
Its types are:
i. Regresssion: Predicting continuous values (e.g., predicting house prices).
ii. Classification: Categorizing data into discrete classes (e.g., spam or not spam).

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, where the algorithm must find hidden patterns, structures, and relationships on its own without predefined outcomes. 
Its types are:
i. Clustering: Groups similar data points into clusters (e.g., segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior).
ii. Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces the number of features in a dataset while preserving essential information (e.g., for data visualization or feature selection).
iii. Association Rule Mining: Discovers interesting relationships between variables in large databases (e.g., items frequently bought together in a supermarket).

3. Semi-supervised Learning
This approach uses a combination of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. It is particularly useful when obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming, but large amounts of unlabeled data are readily available.

4. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning trains an "agent" to make a sequence of decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is for the agent to learn the best strategy (policy) to maximize the cumulative reward over time through trial and error.
